### Welcome there!

This repository is meant to provide Examples of some of my works on Web Scraping.

I have put each project in a seperate folder. Each project contains the Jupyter notebook of my code and the outout file (Scraped data).

I have used different libraries to reach my results. Such as requests, Beautiful Soup, Selenium, and Pandas.

In some cases, the structure of the website requires useing different technique such as hidden APIs. 

I plan to add more projects in the future.

Thanks!
